# Library Management System

This admin-side Online Library Management System is a web application that enables administrators to manage book records and users. It was developed using ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and C#. The application allows administrators to add, update, and delete book records and users, and it uses Entity Framework to interact with data stored in a database.
